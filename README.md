The original project aims to provide Java source file formatting using the Eclipse code formatter as a Maven plugin.  

Here I aim to provide file formatting accross languages.  So far, java and javascript meet my needs, HTML, XML and Scala are on my plans, but not limited to.
Also, this project also provides m2e configurator.  So you can be sure the IDE form the entire development team is properly configured.

It was started after having read an article posted [here](http://ssscripting.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/how-to-use-the-eclipse-code-formatter-from-your-code/) (thanks to John for writing such a helpful article).
